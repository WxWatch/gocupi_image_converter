This set of tools is capable of turning a GIF into an SVG for use with the gocupi Polargraph (www.gocupi.com) 

Usage:
	1. Insert any GIFs you wish to be converted into the ‘input’ folder
	2. Run the “CreateImages” script (double-clicking seems to work fine)
	3. Let it run … your SVG images should now be in the ‘output’ folder

Let me know if you run into any difficulties.
